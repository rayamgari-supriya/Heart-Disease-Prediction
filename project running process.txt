🧠 HOW TO RUN DJANGO PROJECT (with MySQL) IN PYCHARM
📍 Step 1: Open XAMPP and Start Services

Open XAMPP Control Panel.

Click Start next to:

✅ Apache

✅ MySQL

Once both are green, your local MySQL server is running at localhost:3306.

📂 Step 2: Open the Project in PyCharm

Open PyCharm → click File → Open.

Browse to your project folder (example:

C:\Users\rayam\Downloads\HeartDisease prediction with navie bayas


) and open it.

Wait until indexing is complete.

⚙️ Step 3: Set the Working Directory (if needed)

If the terminal opens at the wrong path, type:

cd "HeartDisease prediction with navie bayas/HeartDisease prediction with navie bayas/HeartDisease prediction"


(Adjust the path if your folder structure differs.)

You should now see your terminal prompt like:

PS C:\Users\rayam\Downloads\HeartDisease prediction with navie bayas\HeartDisease prediction with navie bayas\HeartDisease prediction>

🧱 Step 4: Run Migrations

Before starting the server, apply database migrations:

python manage.py migrate


This will create all the necessary tables in MySQL (or SQLite if configured).

🚀 Step 5: Run the Server

Now start your Django development server:

python manage.py runserver


If everything is fine, you’ll see something like:

Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

🌐 Step 6: Open the Project in Browser

Go to your browser and type:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/


If your app has specific pages, try:

/admin/ → for Django admin

/predict/ → for prediction page

/home/ → for homepage

🔑 Step 7: (Optional) Create Superuser for Admin Panel

If you need access to Django admin:

python manage.py createsuperuser


Then enter:

Username

Email (optional)

Password

After that, visit:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/


and log in with your credentials.

💾 Step 8: Stop the Server

When done, press:

Ctrl + C


in the terminal to stop the running server.
